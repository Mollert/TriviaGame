I struggled with the time on this project.  I just could not come up with a good concept and then I spent too much time on the images, HTML and CSS.  This project was the first time I used reset css and I soon realized there were no freebee's.  I had to enhance each element (more time).  I think my JavaScript was very elementary.  I could not get the timer to work like I wanted to.  It seemed I did not plan very well, being I got half way through and wanted to go a different way but did not have the time.  This one I will forget!!!
